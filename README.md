# 🌊 Global Earthquake-Tsunami Risk Assessment Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Risk Assessment Modeling** by analyzing geological factors contributing to tsunami occurrences. The goal is to build predictive models that can classify tsunami risk levels and estimate earthquake magnitude, aiding in disaster preparedness and risk mitigation strategies.

## 🎯 key Objectives
* To analyze the correlation between geological variables and tsunami occurrences.
* To develop high-accuracy classification models for risk prediction.
* To identify key risk drivers (Feature Importance).

## 🧠 Models & Techniques
* **Models Used:** Random Forest, XGBoost
* **Tasks:**
    * **Classification:** Predicting Tsunami Risk (High/Low)
    * **Regression:** Estimating Earthquake Magnitude
* **Performance:** Achieved **90% Prediction Accuracy**

## 📊 Key Findings
* Evaluated model performance using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy scores.
